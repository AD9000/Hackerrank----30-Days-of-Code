# Hackerrank----30-Days-of-Code
## Introduction
The 30 Days of code module from Hackerrank, solved by Atharv Damle (In Java and C). 

The 30 Days of code module on Hackerrank aims to provide an introduction to coding. This repository is meant to help you out if you get stuck along the way. All the code is ideally just for reference and I do not recommend copying it. Analyse it. Understand it. Hit me up if you have any issues!

Have fun coding, all!

PS:
I am always looking to better my code so any improvement tips (especially concerned with efficiency) are welcome.

## Further thoughts:
The repo is only in Java at the moment (and some C). But I plan to add code for Python, C++, JavaScript, C and any other language I learn!
